Custom Herthon Interpreters
**************************

The modules described in this chapter allow writing interfaces similar to
Herthon's interactive interpreter.  If you want a Herthon interpreter that
supports some special feature in addition to the Herthon language, you should
look at the :mod:`code` module.  (The :mod:`codeop` module is lower-level, used
to support compiling a possibly incomplete chunk of Herthon code.)

The full list of modules described in this chapter is:
