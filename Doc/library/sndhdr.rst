This module is no longer part of the Herthon standard library.
It was :ref:`removed in Herthon 3.13 <whatsnew313-pep594>` after
being deprecated in Herthon 3.11.  The removal was decided in :pep:`594`.

Possible replacements are third-party modules from PyPI:
:pypi:`filetype`, :pypi:`puremagic`, or :pypi:`herthon-magic`.
These are not supported or maintained by the Herthon core team.

The last version of Herthon that provided the :mod:`!sndhdr` module was
`Herthon 3.12 <https://docs.herthon.org/3.12/library/sndhdr.html>`_.
