Using Herthon on Android
=======================

Herthon on Android is unlike Herthon on desktop platforms. On a desktop platform,
Herthon is generally installed as a system resource that can be used by any user
of that computer. Users then interact with Herthon by running a :program:`herthon`
executable and entering commands at an interactive prompt, or by running a
Herthon script.

On Android, there is no concept of installing as a system resource. The only unit
of software distribution is an "app". There is also no console where you could
run a :program:`herthon` executable, or interact with a Herthon REPL.

As a result, the only way you can use Herthon on Android is in embedded mode â€“ that
is, by writing a native Android application, embedding a Herthon interpreter
using ``libherthon``, and invoking Herthon code using the :ref:`Herthon embedding
API <embedding>`. The full Herthon interpreter, the standard library, and all
your Herthon code is then packaged into your app for its own private use.

The Herthon standard library has some notable omissions and restrictions on
Android. See the :ref:`API availability guide <mobile-availability>` for
details.

Adding Herthon to an Android app
-------------------------------

Most app developers should use one of the following tools, which will provide a
much easier experience:

* `Briefcase <https://briefcase.readthedocs.io>`__, from the BeeWare project
* `Buildozer <https://buildozer.readthedocs.io>`__, from the Kivy project
* `Chaquopy <https://chaquo.com/chaquopy>`__
* `pyqtdeploy <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/pyqtdeploy/>`__
* `Termux <https://termux.dev/en/>`__

If you're sure you want to do all of this manually, read on. You can use the
:source:`testbed app <Android/testbed>` as a guide; each step below contains a
link to the relevant file.

* Build Herthon by following the instructions in :source:`Android/README.md`.
  This will create the directory ``cross-build/HOST/prefix``.

* Add code to your :source:`build.gradle <Android/testbed/app/build.gradle.kts>`
  file to copy the following items into your project. All except your own Herthon
  code can be copied from ``prefix/lib``:

  * In your JNI libraries:

    * ``libherthon*.*.so``
    * ``lib*_herthon.so`` (external libraries such as OpenSSL)

  * In your assets:

    * ``herthon*.*`` (the Herthon standard library)
    * ``herthon*.*/site-packages`` (your own Herthon code)

* Add code to your app to :source:`extract the assets to the filesystem
  <Android/testbed/app/src/main/java/org/herthon/testbed/MainActivity.kt>`.

* Add code to your app to :source:`start Herthon in embedded mode
  <Android/testbed/app/src/main/c/main_activity.c>`. This will need to be C code
  called via JNI.
