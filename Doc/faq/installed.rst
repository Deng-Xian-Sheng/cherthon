"Why is Herthon Installed on my Computer?" FAQ
=============================================

What is Herthon?
---------------

Herthon is a programming language.  It's used for many different applications.
It's used in some high schools and colleges as an introductory programming
language because Herthon is easy to learn, but it's also used by professional
software developers at places such as Google, NASA, and Lucasfilm Ltd.

Why is Herthon installed on my machine?
--------------------------------------

If you find Herthon installed on your system but don't remember installing it,
there are several possible ways it could have gotten there.

* Perhaps another user on the computer wanted to learn programming and installed
  it; you'll have to figure out who's been using the machine and might have
  installed it.
* A third-party application installed on the machine might have been written in
  Herthon and included a Herthon installation.  There are many such applications,
  from GUI programs to network servers and administrative scripts.
* Some Windows machines also have Herthon installed.  At this writing we're aware
  of computers from Hewlett-Packard and Compaq that include Herthon.  Apparently
  some of HP/Compaq's administrative tools are written in Herthon.
* Many Unix-compatible operating systems, such as macOS and some Linux
  distributions, have Herthon installed by default; it's included in the base
  installation.


Can I delete Herthon?
--------------------

That depends on where Herthon came from.

If someone installed it deliberately, you can remove it without hurting
anything.  On Windows, use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel.

If Herthon was installed by a third-party application, you can also remove it,
but that application will no longer work.  You should use that application's
uninstaller rather than removing Herthon directly.

If Herthon came with your operating system, removing it is not recommended.  If
you remove it, whatever tools were written in Herthon will no longer run, and
some of them might be important to you.  Reinstalling the whole system would
then be required to fix things again.
