The C API is divided into these sections:

1. ``Include/``: Limited API
2. ``Include/cherthon/``: CHerthon implementation details
3. ``Include/cherthon/``, names with the ``PyUnstable_`` prefix: API that can
   change between minor releases
4. ``Include/internal/``, and any name with ``_`` prefix: The internal API
